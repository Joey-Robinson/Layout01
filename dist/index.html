        <p>This is my personal website. I will constantly be updating and changing this. Take a lot around, I started
          with mobile first for this iteration, and hope you like it.
          All questions, concerns and critiques, feel free to contact me. If you don't really like something, that's
          ok. Because I didn't make it for you, I made it for me. Made with CSS Grid

        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p>I started web development in late 2017 an instantly fell in love with it. Being able to create something
          from nothing fascinates me. Especially being able to create something to your own liking is something that
          amazes me daily. I am constantly looking to improve myself not only as a developer but as a person as well.
          My primary focus is HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with some React on top.
        </p>

        <h1>Interests:</h1>
        <p>
          Besides Coding, I enjoy a wide variety of things. I like gaming, my primary games are World of Warcraft and
          Final Fantasy 14. If and when I have time, I also like to play Dota 2. Additionaly, I enjoy reading fantasy
          books (The Name of The Wind is my favorite) as well as the lore surrounding the fantasy. Finally, I enjoy
          reading about upcoming developer technologies.
