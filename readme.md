Title: "Layout #1"
Description: "A series of layouts using CSS Grid. This is the first."

Like the description says. I'll be making a series of layouts for anyone to use. This is the first, which will be a recreation of my personal site. I'll update down the line with instructions.

# Instructions:

git clone [the repo](https://github.com/Joey-Robinson/Layout01.git)

change directory into the repo

```
npm i
```

or

```
npm install
```

# Post-Install

```
npm start
```

If you get an error on start, type the following into terminal:

```
npm install -g node-sass
```

Then type

```
npm start
```

Note: You need to make a CSS Folder with main.css if one isn't present on cloning.
