Like the description says. I'll be making a series of layouts for anyone to use. This is the first, which will be a recreation of my personal site. I'll update down the line with instructions.

Instructions:

git clone [the repo](https://github.com/Joey-Robinson/Layout01.git)

change directory into the repo

```
npm i
```

or

```
npm install
```
