// This is for blog.html. It's using a 3 column div, 5rem on left and right, 1fr in the middle
// To give it a sense of padding without having to explicitly define the padding. Since this layout was
// Made for GatsbyJS, you might not need this. If that's the case, just delete _blog.scss and blog.html, 
// As well as any traces of 'blog'. (Note: You'll most likely need to fix the header if you decide to do that)
